# Sales Performance Dashboard

## Overview
"""
This project analyzes sales data to identify trends, top-performing products, regions, and other key metrics.
The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving sales performance and profitability.
The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard that visualizes the data and highlights key findings.
"""

## Dataset
"""
The dataset used for this project is the Superstore Dataset, which contains sales, profit, and customer data for a fictional retail store.
It includes the following columns:
- Order ID
- Product Name
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Sales
- Profit
- Region
- State
- Customer Segment
- Order Date

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final
"""

## Tools Used
"""
- Data Cleaning and Analysis: Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, or Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Dashboard Creation: Tableau, Power BI, or Python (Dash)
"""

## Key Metrics
"""
The dashboard focuses on the following metrics:
1. Total Sales: Sum of all sales.
2. Total Profit: Sum of all profits.
3. Profit Margin: (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100.
4. Sales by Region: Breakdown of sales across different regions.
5. Sales by Product Category: Breakdown of sales by product category (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).
6. Monthly/Quarterly Sales Trends: Line chart showing sales over time.
7. Top-Performing Products: List of top 5 products by sales.
8. Customer Segmentation: Sales by customer segment (e.g., Corporate, Home Office, Consumer).
"""

## Steps
"""
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
   - Formatted columns (e.g., dates, currency).
   - Created additional columns for analysis (e.g., Month, Quarter, Profit Margin).

2. Data Analysis:
   - Calculated key metrics (e.g., total sales, profit margin).
   - Identified trends and patterns (e.g., seasonality, regional performance).

3. Visualization:
   - Created charts and graphs to represent the data.
   - Combined visualizations into an interactive dashboard.

4. Dashboard Creation:
   - Built the dashboard using Tableau, Power BI, or Python (Dash).
   - Added filters and interactivity for a user-friendly experience.
"""
